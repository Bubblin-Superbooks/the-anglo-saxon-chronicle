one in Devonshire, and in Cornwall, and in Worcester.  Then
Leofric (61) succeeded to Devonshire and to Cornwall, and Bishop
Aldred to Worcester.  And in this year Osgod, the master of the
horse, was outlawed: and Magnus [King of Norway] won Denmark.  In
this year there was a great council in London at mid-Lent, and
nine ships of lightermen were discharged, and five remained
behind.  In this same year came Sweyn the earl into England.  And
in this same year was the great synod at Rome, and King Edward
sent thither Bishop Heroman and Bishop Aldred; and they came
thither on Easter eve.  And afterwards the pope held a synod at
Vercelli, and Bishop Ulf came thereto; and well nigh would they
have broken his staff, if he had not given very great gifts;
because he knew not how to do his duty so well as he should.  And
in this year died Archbishop Eadsine, on the fourth before the
kalends of November.))</p></div> </div>
