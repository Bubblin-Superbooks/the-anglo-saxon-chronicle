the swarthy raven
with horny nib,

with the eagle swift

No slaughter yet
was greater made
e'er in this island,
of people slain,
before this same,
with the edge of the sword;
as the books inform us
of the old historians;
since hither came
from the eastern shores
the Angles and Saxons,
over the broad sea,
and Britain sought,â€”
fierce battle-smiths,
o'ercame the Welsh,
most valiant earls,
and gained the land.</p><p>A.D. 941.  This year King Athelstan died in Glocester, on the
sixth day before the calends of November, about forty-one
winters, bating one night, from the time when King Alfred died.
