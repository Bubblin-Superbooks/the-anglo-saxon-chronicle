<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>A.D. 1003.  This year was Exeter demolished, through the French
churl Hugh, whom the lady had appointed her steward there.  And
the army destroyed the town withal, and took there much spoil.
In the same year came the army up into Wiltshire.  Then was
collected a very great force, from Wiltshire and from Hampshire;
which was soon ready on their march against the enemy: and
Alderman Elfric should have led them on; but he brought forth his
old tricks, and as soon as they were so near, that either army
looked on the other, then he pretended sickness, and began to
retch, saying he was sick; and so betrayed the people that he
should have led: as it is said, "When the leader is sick the
whole army is hindered."  When Sweyne saw that they were not
ready, and that they all retreated, then led he his army into
Wilton; and they plundered and burned the town.  Then went he to
Sarum; and thence back to the sea, where he knew his ships were.</p></div> </div>
