<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Warning:</h4><p class="  start-chapter">While I have elected to include the footnotes of Rev. Ingram in
this edition, please note that they should be used with extreme
care.  In many cases the views expressed by Rev. Ingram are
severally out of date, having been superseded by almost 175 years
of active scholarship.  At best, these notes will provide a
starting point for inquiry.  They should not, however, be treated
as absolute.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
