formerly the wife of the Emperor of Saxony.  Afterwards he sent
her to Normandy; and with her went her brother Robert, Earl of
Glocester, and Brian, son of the Earl Alan Fergan; (154) and he
let her wed the son of the Earl of Anjou, whose name was Geoffry
Martel.  All the French and English, however, disapproved of
this; but the king did it for to have the alliance of the Earl
of Anjou, and for to have help against his nephew William.  In
the Lent-tide of this same year was the Earl Charles of Flanders
slain in a church, as he lay there and prayed to God, before the
altar, in the midst of the mass, by his own men.  And the King of
France brought William, the son of the Earl of Normandy, and gave
him the earldom; and the people of that land accepted him.  This
same William had before taken to wife the daughter of the Earl of
Anjou;</p></div> </div>
