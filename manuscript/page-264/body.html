<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>A.D. 1002.  This year the king and his council agreed that
tribute should be given to the fleet, and peace made with them,
with the provision that they should desist from their mischief.
Then sent the king to the fleet Alderman Leofsy, who at the
king's word and his council made peace with them, on condition
that they received food and tribute; which they accepted, and a
tribute was paid of 24,000 pounds.  In the meantime Alderman
Leofsy slew Eafy, high-steward of the king; and the king banished
him from the land.  Then, in the same Lent, came the Lady Elfgive
Emma, Richard's daughter, to this land.  And in the same summer
died Archbishop Eadulf; and also, in the same year the king gave
an order to slay all the Danes that were in England.  This was
accordingly done on the mass-day of St. Brice; because it was
told the king, that they would beshrew him of his life, and
afterwards all his council, and then have his kingdom without any
resistance.</p></div> </div>
