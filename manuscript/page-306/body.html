all England very nigh twenty years.  And soon after his decease
there was a meeting of all the witan at Oxford; and Leofric, the
earl, and almost all the thanes north of the Thames, and the
"lithsmen" at London, chose Harold for chief of all England, him
and his brother Hardecanute who was in Denmark.  And Godwin the
earl and all the chief men of Wessex withstood it as long as they
could; but they were unable to effect anything in opposition to
it.  And then it was decreed that Elfgive, Hardecanute's mother,
should dwell at Winchester with the king's, her son's, household,
and hold all Wessex in his power; and Godwin the earl was
their man.  Some men said of Harold that he was son of King
Canute and of Elfgive, daughter of Elfelm the ealdorman, but it
seemed quite incredible to many men; and he was nevertheless full
king over all England.))</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A.D. 1037. This year men chose Harold king over</p></div> </div>
