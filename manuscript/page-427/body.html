Peterborough, was this year betrayed, and led to Westminster; and
his brother Egelwine was outlawed.  This year also died Brand,

England; and after a few days he became Archbishop of Canterbury.
He was invested on the fourth before the calends of September in
his own see by eight bishops, his suffragans.  The others, who
were not there, by messengers and by letter declared why they
could not be there.  The same year Thomas, who was chosen Bishop
of York, came to Canterbury, to be invested there after the
ancient custom.  But when Landfranc craved confirmation of his
obedience with an oath, he refused; and said, that he ought not
to do it. </p></div> </div>
