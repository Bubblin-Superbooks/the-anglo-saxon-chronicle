chronicle, as the editor considered it.  The text of the present
edition, it was found, could not be compressed within a shorter
compass than 374 pages, though the editor has suppressed many
notes and illustrations, which may be thought necessary to the
general reader.  Some variations in the MSS. may also still
remain unnoticed; partly because they were considered of little
importance, and partly from an apprehension, lest the commentary,
as it sometimes happens, should seem an unwieldy burthen, rather
than a necessary appendage, to the text.  Indeed, till the editor
had made some progress in the work, he could not have imagined
that so many original and authentic materials of our history
still remained unpublished.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">To those who are unacquainted with this monument of our national
antiquities, two questions appear requisite to be answered:â€”
"What does it contain?" and, "By whom was it written?" </p></div> </div>
