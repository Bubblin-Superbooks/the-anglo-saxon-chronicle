through all this land amongst his subjects, who fed them, each
according to his quota of land.  Men suffered much distress this
year; and the king caused the land to be laid waste about the sea
coast; that, if his foes came up, they might not have anything on
which they could very readily seize.  But when the king
understood of a truth that his foes were impeded, and could not
further their expedition, (107) then let he some of the army go
to their own land; but some he held in this land over the winter.
Then, at the midwinter, was the king in Glocester with his
council, and held there his court five days.  And afterwards the
archbishop and clergy had a synod three days.  There was
Mauritius chosen Bishop of London, William of Norfolk, and Robert
of Cheshire.  These were all the king's clerks.  After this had
the king a large meeting, and very deep consultation with his
council, about this land; how it was occupied, and by what sort
of men. </p></div> </div>
