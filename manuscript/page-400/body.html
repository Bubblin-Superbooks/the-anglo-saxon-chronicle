the kin of Ethelred,
and the Danes wielded
the dear kingdom
of Engle-land.
Eight and twenty
winters' rounds
they wealth dispensed.
Then came forth
free in his chambers,
in royal array,

Angels carried

on Harold himself,
the noble earl;
who in every season
faithfully heard
and obeyed his lord,
in word and deed;

what might be wanted
by the nation's king.
