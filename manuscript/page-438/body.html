of William Fitz-Osborne to wife.  This same Ralph was British on
his mother's side; but his father, whose name was also Ralph, was
English; and born in Norfolk.  The king therefore gave his son
the earldom of Norfolk and Suffolk; and he then led the bride to
Norwich.
There was that bride-ale
The source of man's bale.
There was Earl Roger, and Earl Waltheof, and bishops, and abbots;
who there resolved, that they would drive the king out of the
realm of England.  But it was soon told the king in Normandy how
it was determined.  It was Earl Roger and Earl Ralph who were the
authors of that plot; and who enticed the Britons to them, and
sent eastward to Denmark after a fleet to assist them.  Roger
went westward to his earldom, and collected his people there, to
the king's annoyance, as he thought; but it was to the great
disadvantage of himself. </p></div> </div>
