the king commanded the Archbishop Theodorus, that he should
appoint a general Wittenmoot at the place called Hatfield.  When
they were there collected, then he allowed the letter to be read
that the pope sent thither; and all ratified and confirmed it.
Then said the king: "All things that my brother Peada, and my
brother Wulfere, and my sisters, Kyneburga and Kyneswitha, gave
and granted to St. Peter and the abbot, these I will may stand;
and I will in my day increase it, for their souls and for my
soul.  Now give I St. Peter to-day into his minster, Medhamsted,

Repings, Cadney, Swineshead, Hanbury, Lodeshall, Scuffanhall,
Cosford, Stratford, Wattleburn, Lushgard, Ethelhun-island,
Bardney.  These lands I give St. Peter just as freely as I
possessed them myself; and so, that none of my successors take
anything therefrom.  Whoso doeth it,</p></div> </div>
