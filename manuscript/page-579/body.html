to the accession of Edward the Martyr, should be added here—</p><p>In his days,
On account of his youth,
The opponents of God
Broke through God's laws;
Alfhere alderman,
And others many;
And marr'd monastic rules;
Minsters they razed,
And monks drove away,
And put God's laws to flight—
Laws that King Edgar
Commanded the holy
Saint Ethelwold bishop
Firmly to settle—
Widows they stript
Oft and at random.
Many breaches of right
And many bad laws
Have arisen since;
And after-times
Prove only worse.
Then too was Oslac
The mighty earl
Hunted from England's shores.</p><p>(46) Florence of Worcester mentions three synods this year;
Kyrtlinege, Calne, and Ambresbyrig.</p><p>(47) Vid. "Hist. Eliens." ii. 6.  He was a great benefactor to
the church of Ely.</p></div> </div>
