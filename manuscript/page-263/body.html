<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>((A.D. 1001.  This year the army came to Exmouth, and then went
up to the town, and there continued fighting stoutly; but they
were very strenuously resisted.  Then went they through the land,
and did all as was their wont; destroyed and burnt.  Then was
collected a vast force of the people of Devon and of the people
of Somerset, and they then came together at Pen.  And so soon as
they joined battle, then the people gave way: and there they made
great slaughter, and then they rode over the land, and their last
incursion was ever worse than the one before: and then they
brought much booty with them to their ships.  And thence they
went into the Isle of Wight, and there they roved about, even as
they themselves would, and nothing withstood them: nor any fleet
by sea durst meet them; nor land force either, went they ever so
far up.  Then was it in every wise a heavy time, because they
never ceased from their evil doings.))</p></div> </div>
