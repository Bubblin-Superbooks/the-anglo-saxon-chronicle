gathered together about a hundred ships, and was then in Kent
while the ships were sailing along sea by the south-east to meet
him.  The army therefore supposed that the greatest part of his
force was in the ships, and that they might go, without being
attacked, where that ever they would.  When the king learned on
enquiry that they were gone out on plunder, he sent his army both
from Wessex and Mercia; and they came up with the rear of the
enemy as he was on his way homeward, and there fought with him
and put him to flight, and slew many thousands of his men.  There

Governors Agmund, Othulf, and Benesing; Anlaf the Swarthy, and
Governor Thunferth; Osferth the collector, and Governor
Guthferth.</p><p>((A.D. 911.  Then the next year after this died Ethelred, lord of
