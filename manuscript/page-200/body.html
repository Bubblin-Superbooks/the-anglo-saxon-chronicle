Then Prince Ethelwald, the son of his paternal uncle, rode
against the towns of Winburn and of Twineham, without leave of
the king and his council.  Then rode the king with his army; so
that he encamped the same night at Badbury near Winburn; and
Ethelwald remained within the town with the men that were under
him, and had all the gates shut upon him, saying, that he would
either there live or there die.  But in the meantime he stole
away in the night, and sought the army in Northumberland.  The
king gave orders to ride after him; but they were not able to
overtake him.  The Danes, however, received him as their king.
They then rode after the wife that Ethelwald had taken without
the king's leave, and against the command of the bishops; for she
was formerly consecrated a nun.  In this year also died Ethered,
who was alderman of Devonshire, four weeks before King Alfred.</p></div> </div>
